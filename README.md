# Serial Server with TCP interupt
To be used on a Raspberry Pi  
This will let you use USB to serial port to make typical serial connections.  
As well you may run a TCP server that will access serial data.  
##  Idea Here is to Create a Two master Serial connection to a device  
##  One is TCP to Serial the other is Serial to Serial
